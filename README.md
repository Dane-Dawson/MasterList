Collection of entertaining videos about a bunch of different concepts/tools/whatever!
Cracking The Coding Interview YouTube Series
Great resource, highly recommend getting the book as well, regularly updated with tips and tricks for interviewing, as well as approaching algorithms for interviews.
##Misc
Awesome List - curated list of resources across all things code. Googling “awesome list <topic>” will find you subcategories that you can explore at your leisure. This is it’s own curated list of links that I *did not* create, and a substantial amount of time has gone into upkeep and updating it. Glance through it now but bookmark it for later, you’ll thank yourself on your next project.
Over API
Reference sheets for...almost any language. Definitely check this out, if this style works for you it can make looking up built in methods/functions for languages and frameworks a lot easier.
https://textcraft.net/
Create simple .png or .jpg images of custom logo banners easily, some recognizable video game/cartoon logos available.
VS code shortcuts reference sheet
Mac OS VS code shortcuts
Windows VS code shortcuts
https://www.humblebundle.com/
Collections of all kinds of things at a discount price, proceeds go towards charities. Check regularly, they will often have programming books/software/tools!
https://pixlr.com/x/
Free, web based simple photo editing. Like Photoshop Lite (extremely Lite).
Another list
Another collection of links I found a while back, a few I have explored are on this list but most are not. I liked too many to add to this “highlights” list here, so you can dig through this on your own for treasure.
##Computer Science/Programming Education
Stanford Free Online CS classes
Self explanatory! I recommend this intro to algorithms
MIT Free Online CS courses
If you’re completely new to computer science, try this intro to CS course
https://academy.zenva.com
Mostly tech/code focused, courses available for purchase and completed at your own pace.
https://udemy.com
Courses on everything, and lots of good code courses. Add desired courses to your cart and wait for them to go on sale (it happens several times a month usually) to buy full courses for <$20.
https://www.w3schools.com/
Resources for HTML, JavaScript, AI, and more! For free!?! Amazing.
##Project Planning/whiteboarding
www.trello.com
Amazing free resource for collaborative project management. Kanban boards are popular in the tech field
Information on how to use a Kanban board
https://app.diagrams.net/ (Formerly known as draw.io)
I use this personally in my model planning and basic whiteboarding. Tricky to get used to sometimes (controls can be clunky/non-intuitive) but once familiar this can be used to quickly draw out model details and relationships, storyboarding, even basic format planning
Figma
Extremely popular (and free!) resource for UI/UX design. Again, somewhat steep learning curve but, when proficient, can create actual prototypes that flow with user clicks and even export style sheets in usable code based on your design.
##JavaScript
Awesome List of JavaScript resources
Data viewing/manipulating tools
Canvas JS
Chart JS
https://jscomplete.com/
Bunch of resources specific to JavaScript

React Chrome
You should have these if you work with react. Don’t forget to use them!
Redux Chrome
See above entry.
##Algorithms
https://www.codewars.com
Fun way to approach some algorithm practice. In your profile, type clan name  RoundCopper to join the (very informal) clan with some other Flatiron students.
https://leetcode.com/
Really great resource for continued ed or practice for programming.
https://adventofcode.com/
Play on the Advent calendar, they release a new logic/coding puzzle every day starting Dec 1st up to Christmas.
##Gamified Code Learning
https://www.twilio.com/quest
General code, old school pixelated RPG feel. Freemium!
https://screeps.com/
